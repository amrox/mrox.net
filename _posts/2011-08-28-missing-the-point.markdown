[Ricardo Bilton commenting on Steve Jobs' resignation](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/gadgetreviews/what-steve-jobs-means-to-me-absolutely-nothing/27162):

> &hellip; I can’t seem to draw the connection between Steve Jobs the man and Steve Jobs the man who led the company that created the computer I am currently using. I simply can’t conflate the two.

> I don’t, for example, praise the inventor of the microwave every time I nuke a pair of Hot Pockets. Nor do I, to my knowledge, silently thank Garrett Morgan every time I cross the street. There is a difference, I think, between appreciating a product on a personal level and virtually idolizing those who had a part in creating it.

I think Bilton is missing the point. As [Benjamin and Gruber mentioned on the Talk Show](http://5by5.tv/talkshow/56), Steve Jobs is more of a Walt Disney than a Thomas Edison (let alone a Garret Morgan).

Steve Jobs' real accomplishment is not the Mac, iPod, iPhone. It's creating a community whose culture is ruthlessly committed to creating the best products possible. That's why he has a following beyond other CEOs and inventors. We all love great products, but great communities have far more impact.
