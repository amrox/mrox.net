The iPhone app we built for [Wolfgang's Vault](http://concerts.wolfgangsvault.com/), [Concert Vault](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=294355484&mt=8) (iTunes link), was awarded [Best iPhone/iPod touch application](http://www.macworld.co.uk/mac/news/index.cfm?newsid=26313) by Macworld UK.

This is *quite* the pleasant surprise.  I had no idea it was even being considered.  It's an honor to be chosen out of all of the nominees, which are all great apps.  I use several of them myself. 

Working with Wolfgang's Vault has been a great experience and we're excited to continue building apps to deliver their extraordinary content on the iPhone platform.
