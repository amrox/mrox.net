I attended the recent [An Event Apart](http://aneventapart.com/2009/boston/) conference in Boston.  An Event Apart is aimed at designers who build websites, and has a standards-oriented slant.

I am not a designer, but I have to play one from time to time.  I don't plan to make designing websites my primary focus, but some basic skills is necessary these days.  Also I think the web *might not* be a passing fad, so investing in some expertise in that realm would probably pay off in the long run  AEA seemed like a good way to jump-start that area of my professional skill set.

The talks were very high quality across the board, and the topics ranged from design psychology to CSS nuts and bolts.  I found [Jason Santa Maria](http://aneventapart.com/speakers/jasonsantamaria/) and [Dan Cederholm](http://aneventapart.com/speakers/dancederholm/) to have the most useful technical content.  [Whitney Hess](http://aneventapart.com/speakers/whitneyhess/)'s DIY UX talk and [Kristina Halvorson](http://aneventapart.com/speakers/kristinahalvorson/)'s Content Strategy talk both had great information from a less technical, but still development-related standpoint.  From a general-interest perspective, [Jared Spool](http://aneventapart.com/speakers/jaredspool/) on Amazon and [SimpleScott](http://aneventapart.com/speakers/simplescott/) on the Obama campaign website were extremely interesting.

Beyond the talks, the conference itself was a great experience.  The presenters were very down to earth, and I met a lot of cool people.  The designers didn't even seem to mind that I wasn't "one of them".

A few personal key takeaways:

-  *"Websites don't need to look the same in every browser."* This was the mantra of the conference.  We were made to chant it over and over until it permeated our souls (just kidding (sorta)).
-  Grid-based layouts are your friend.
-  Fluid layouts are cool.
-  Sketch.  *"Sketchbooks are not about being a good artist, they're  about being a good thinker."* - Jason Santa Maria.
-  *"The behavior you're seeing is the behavior you've designed for."* - Joshua Porter
-  Charge for the value you bring to a client, not the hours you work.

I didn't take many pictures but instead outsourced them via the  [AEA Boston 09 Flickr pool](http://www.flickr.com/groups/aeaboston09/).

Finally, I wanted to put some of my newfound skills and excitement to use.  Without further adieu, I give you: [doesthissitejustshowonebigword.com](http://doesthissitejustshowonebigword.com).
