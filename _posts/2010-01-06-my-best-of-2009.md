title: My Best of 2009
existing_url: http://mrox.net/blog/2010/01/06/my-best-of-2009/
---

I decided to share a few of my favorite things of 2009. Yes I know 2009 was *so last week*, but I think this post still lands within the relevancy window.

My list doesn't necessarily includes things that were newly created last year, but rather things that were new-to-me, or made a significant impact on me within the year. And we'll start it off with…

## Trip: Prague/Munich/Ghent

I went to Prague, Munich (Oktoberfest), and Ghent (for the third time) in September with two friends. It was, of course, awesome. Amazingly though, I still haven't posted pictures from the trip. New Year's resolution: suck less.

### Runner-Up: (Tie) [AEA](http://mrox.net/blog/2009/06/26/an-event-apart-09/)/[ACBF](http://beeradvocate.com/acbf/) (Boston), [WWDC](http://mrox.net/blog/2009/06/18/wwdc-09-post-mortem/) (San Francisco)

It may seem like I'm cheating by listing *every* place I went in 2009, but I couldn't really decide which trip was better. Both included technical conferences, good friends, and great memories.

## Local Event: [Philly Beer Week 2009](http://www.phillybeerweek.org/)

Philly Beer Week came at just the right time for me, and it was a lot of fun. Some standout sub-events were the [Voodoo](http://www.voodoobrewery.com/) tasting at [Doobie's](http://www.yelp.com/biz/doobies-philadelphia) and the Zythos Belgian Beer Fest to cap off the week.

### Runner-Up: [BarCamp Philly 2009](http://www.barcampphilly.org/)

Philly's second BarCamp was twice as good as the first. If this trend continues…

## Blog: [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net)

I've been a DF reader for years, but this year I decided to support Mr. Gruber and buy a membership. It's my favorite blog.

### Runner-Up: [UI&us](http://www.uiandus.com/)

UI design is one of the most challenging, but also interesting aspects of software development for me, and this blog put forth a lot of great ideas. Plus Keith Lang is a really nice guy.

## Programming Site: [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)

I was a little skeptical at first, but Stack Overflow has definitely changed the Q&A landscape for the better. It's hard to go back to forums and mailing lists.

### Runner-Up: [GitHub](http://github.com/)

I've only skimmed the surface, but so far I'm impressed with GitHub. It really delivers on the promise of "Social Coding".

## Local (Philly) Site: (Tie) [Technically Philly](http://technicallyphilly.com/), [Unbreaded](http://unbreaded.com/)

Both blogs are well-written and on-topic. I couldn't pick a clear favorite, so they'll share the honor.

### Runner-Up: [uwishunu](http://www.uwishunu.com/)

It's not a new site, but it's become my favorite place to find fun and interesting things to do in my fair city.

## Album: [Jaydiohead](http://jaydiohead.com/)

Yes, a mashup album. Why? Because it rocks, and made a 30-year-old white guy who never cared for Jay-Z before into a fan.

### Runner-Up: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CZOUCG?ie=UTF8&tag=andymroczblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001CZOUCG">Infinity + 1 by A-Track</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=andymroczblog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001CZOUCG" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

I picked this up from an Amazon MP3 deal on a whim, not knowing what to expect. Since then slowly but surely embedded itself in my brain. Super fun mix.

## Movie: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KVZ6FW?ie=UTF8&tag=andymroczblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001KVZ6FW">Up</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=andymroczblog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001KVZ6FW" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Great film. [Squirrel!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxoWHeoYU3g)

### Runner-Up: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WY65VU?ie=UTF8&tag=andymroczblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002WY65VU">Zombieland</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=andymroczblog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002WY65VU" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Zombieland produced the most real-life LOLs for of any movie I saw in the theatre all year. Worth it for the Bill Murray cameo alone.

## TV Show: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fentity%2FPushing-Daisies%2FB001CHNIWC%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dep%255Fsprkl%255Ftv%255FB001CHNIWC&tag=andymroczblog-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957">Pushing Daisies</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=andymroczblog-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

I know Pushing Daisies was actually cancelled before 2009 began, but it's new to me. I loved the characters and the feel of the show. My only gripe was the rushed ending of the second season, but that is obviously attributed to it's cancellation.

### Runner-Up: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6GUW0?ie=UTF8&tag=andymroczblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000Q6GUW0">Dexter</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=andymroczblog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000Q6GUW0" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Another new-to-me show. I'm not quite sure what I was expecting, but I was surprised by how much I liked this show. I've only finished the first two seasons, but the third is already in my Netflix queue.

## Podcast: [The MDN Show](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=318584787)

The new, unified show from [The Mac Developer Network](http://www.mac-developer-network.com/) became an instant favorite of mine. I liked all the previous shows, but it's nice having the content all in one place.

### Runner-Up: [Stack Overflow](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=279215411)

I can't exactly put my finger on *why* I like the Stack Overflow podcast so much, but I keep coming back to it. I think there is a good dynamic between [Joel](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/) and [Jeff](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/). It's also fun to listen to them discuss anything Apple-related. It's like two polar bears trading tips on life in the rain forest.

## Book (Fiction): <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307476308?ie=UTF8&tag=andymroczblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307476308">The Road</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=andymroczblog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0307476308" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Best novel I've read in awhile. And I read it before I knew it was being made into a movie, which makes my appreciation more *authentic*.

### Runner-Up: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316013323?ie=UTF8&tag=andymroczblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0316013323">Consider the Lobster and Other Essays</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=andymroczblog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0316013323" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> 

I actually consumed this particular work as an audiobook. I highly recommend it, especially since it's read by the author, [David Foster Wallace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace) (may he rest in peace).

## Book (Technical): <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430218150?ie=UTF8&tag=andymroczblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1430218150">Learn Objective–C on the Mac</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=andymroczblog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1430218150" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Although I still think <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321503619?ie=UTF8&tag=andymroczblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321503619">Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=andymroczblog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0321503619" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> is the best text for learning Cocoa, it lacks more foundational information about C and programming basics. We used this book for PhillyCocoa's [Cocoa Programming Foundations Workshop](http://phillycocoa.org/classes/cocoa-foundations/) and were very happy with it.

### Runner-Up: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596517742?ie=UTF8&tag=andymroczblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596517742">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=andymroczblog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0596517742" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Technical books that approach a topic from a particular angle, instead of being just another tutorial or reference really stand out for me. I don't even write much JavaScript, but I really enjoyed this book. Plus it's a short read.

## Mac Application: (Tie) [Acorn](http://www.flyingmeat.com/acorn/), [Opacity](http://likethought.com/opacity/)

I'm not a big fan of Photoshop. It's expensive, cumbersome, and does much more than I need. I wanted some lighter, cheaper, and more geared towards developers. Enter Acorn, a well-designed, scriptable image editor. It's usually the first place I go if I need to work with any graphics. However, this year I discovered a super-interesting application called Opacity. It's obviously designed with the developer in mind, with bindable variables and it's own "build" system. I do almost all my image work in these two apps, hence the tie.

### Runner-Up: [DTerm](http://www.decimus.net/dterm.php)

I was aware of DTerm for awhile, but I didn't "get it" until recently. It's great for interacting with git from within Xcode, and supersedes the "[Open Terminal Here](http://mrox.net/blog/2009/06/05/another-open-terminal-here-toolbar-app/)" applications I've written about previously.

##iPhone Application: [Tweetie 2](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetie-2/id333903271?mt=8)

Great application all-around. I love the "[pull down to refresh](http://twitter.com/amrox/status/7420761307)" feature.

### Runner-Up: [Byline](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/byline/id284946773?mt=8)

Byline is the best Google Reader client I've tried. I love swipe to mark/unmark as read.

## iPhone Game: [Parachute Panic](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/parachute-panic/id317435143?mt=8)

Parachute Panic is a fun, casual game, but it's the hand-drawn graphical style and music that pushed it to the top. ♫ The game is overrrr ♫ But not foreverrrr ♫ Try it again! ♫

### Runner-Up: [Flight Control](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flight-control/id306220440?mt=8)

Again, a fun, casual game whith great graphical style and music.

## Video Game: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ET07O0?ie=UTF8&tag=andymroczblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001ET07O0">House of the Dead: Overkill</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=andymroczblog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001ET07O0" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Yes, its bloody, campy, and kinda stupid, which is exactly why it won. Very fun in that "turn your brain off and shoot at things" kind of way.

### Runner-Up: [Tales of Monkey Island](http://www.telltalegames.com/monkeyisland)

Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate returns. Man, I miss adventure games.

## Brunch: [Café Estelle](http://www.cafeestelle.com/)

Excellent food, friendly staff, and human-sized portions.

### Runner-Up: [Figs](http://www.figsrestaurant.com/)

This little BYO has great egg dishes and the thickest pancakes I've ever seen.

## Lunch Truck: [Honest Tom's Tacos](http://twitter.com/HonestToms)

I love the simplicity of the menu. For lunch, there are two kinds of tacos, coffee, and no step three. The sweet potato tacos are my favorite.

### Runner-Up: [La Dominique](http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-dominique-philadelphia)

This unassuming cart serves up delicious, painstakingly-crafted crêpes on Drexel's campus.

## Restaurant: [Amada](http://www.amadarestaurant.com/)

I've actually been to Amada once previously, but it stood out in my mind as the best restaurant experience I had this year. The "Matador" cocktail was awesome.

### Runner-Up: [The Belgian Café](http://www.thebelgiancafe.com/)

It gets mixed reviews from fellow Fairmount residents, but I really like The Belgian Café. Tasty veggie burgers and impressive beer list. Done.

## Bar: [National Mechanics](http://www.nationalmechanics.com/)

National Mechanics has become the go-to bar of the geek crowd in Philly. I've had several "good times" there this year, so this was an easy choice.

### Runner-Up: [The P.O.P.E.](http://pubonpassyunkeast.com/)

I don't make it out to this South Philly hangout very often, but I have blast every time I do.

## Beer: [Liefmans Cuvée Brut](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/liefmans-cuvee-brut-was-kriekbier/4638/86873/)

This may seem like an odd choice, but I stand by it for a few reasons. First, I was given a tour of the Leifmans brewery in Belgium brewery courtesy of some awesome friends. Second, although sour fruit beers aren't usually my first choice, this is actually a pretty damn good beer.

### Runner-Up: (Tie) [Dogfish Head](http://www.dogfish.com/) [Sah'tea](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/dogfish-head-sahtea/93237/), [Palo Santo Marron](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/dogfish-head-palo-santo-marron/66797/)

And a Dogfish Head double-whammie in the runner-up position. I discovered both these beers in 2009 but under very different circumstances. Palo Santo I first tried during a tour of the Dogfish Head brewery, and Sah'tea at the aforementioned Belgian Café after the first fateful night we spent with the [little monster](http://www.flickr.com/photos/amrox/3953103309/). Friends and I bought and split cases of each.

## Predictions for 2010

* Probably contain around 365 days.
* Still no jetpacks.
* Ragnarök.
