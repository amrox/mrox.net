I am excited to announce that I'll be joining the [MindSnacks](http://mindsnacks.com) team full-time in early January and (temporarily) relocating to the San Francisco Bay Area.

I will now take questions from the audience.

## Whoah. OK, so why MindSnacks?

Great question. Here's the medium version.

I first heard about MindSnacks from a craiglist job posting mentioning 'iPhone', 'learning', and 'games'. I wasn't in the market for a job at the time, but I am passionate about all those things, so I filed it away for future reference.

Fast forward a few months. I was having dinner with an [old friend](http://twitter.com/grexican) who had just finished the [DreamIt Ventures](http://www.dreamitventures.com/) summer program. The conversation ended up on MindSnacks somehow, and he had nothing but good things to say about the team. He asked if I wanted an introduction, and I said "Sure, why not". I thought it was just beer talk. Little did I knowâ€¦

I checked out their first product, [MindSnacks Spanish](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mindsnacks-spanish-language/id385497068?mt=8), and was very impressed. Language learning was something I had always struggled with. Each time I visit Europe (four years in a row now) I feel like an even dumber, mono-lingual American. MindSnacks made learning Spanish words fun, and I began to see huge potential.

So we talked. And I asked questions. And more talk. And more questions. And I spent a week in San Francisco with them. And asked more questions. Trust me, this is not something I jumped into lightly.

I have a high degree confidence in the team and in the business. I'm excited to work in the educational space and have been passionate about games my entire life. It will be hard work, but it will also be really fun, worthwhile experience.

I think we can make some really great stuff.

## WTF? I thought you loved Philly?

I do love Philly. My family is here. My friends are here. My [alma mater](http://www.drexel.edu) is here. My [tribe](http://indyhall.org) is here.

But -- I've never lived outside of the Philly/South Jersey area. I don't think I've even been away from it for more than two weeks in my entire life.

I'm fairly almost certainly probably sure that I want to settle down in this area. However, I'm afraid I will regret never having lived somewhere else, even for a short period. Right now is certainly not the only chance I'll have, but I think it's a local maxima. Things are just working out too well.

It wasn't leaving Philly that was giving me hestiation, it was coming back. I was looking forward to trying a new place for a bit, but I just couldn't commit to being away for 3, 4, 5 years. So we worked out a deal where I am I free to relocate after 1 year in the Bay Area, which for me is perfect. As my friend [Alex](http://twitter.com/alexknowshtml) put it, "one of the main reasons to move to San Francisco, is to leave San Francisco."

Basically, I can't wait to miss Philly.


## What about Amerzing Industries?

First let me say, congratulations! You're one of the three people who actually know about Amerzing Industries! For the rest of you, [Amerzing Industries](http://amerzing.com) is my attempt at a solo consulting business. 

Amerzing Industries won't be taking any new work and will be phasing out existing work, but I'm not going to shut it down completely just yet. Any job has some risk associated with it, so I'm going to tuck it away under "For Emergency Use Only". Plus my good friend [Chad Clark](http://chadjclark.com) designed these [sweet business cards](http://www.flickr.com/photos/amrox/5243956024/), along with the aformentioned website. You don't just throw away top-notch brand concepts like that.

There may be a little more still to come from Amerzing, stay tuned.

## And PhillyCocoa?

When I started [PhillyCocoa](http://phillycocoa.org) over two years ago, the world was a very different place. Barack Obama was still just a glimmer in our collective eyes, the (pop-cultural) Zombie invasion was not yet in full-swing, the App Store was barely a month old, and our beloved "[Fucking NDA](http://gizmodo.com/5028374/iphone-app-devs-still-gagged-by-non+disclosure-agreement-mad-as-fn-hell-about-it)" was still in effect.

We did some neat stuff over the years. We held a [workshop](http://phillycocoa.org/classes/cocoa-foundations/) to help people learn Cocoa, collectively developed an iPhone app for an [*important* Philadelphia event](http://technicallyphilly.com/2010/05/26/shop-talk-philly-beer-week-gets-an-app), and spun off an app development group called [The Ship It Society](http://shipitsociety.com/).

More importantly, I'm proud of the community that has formed around PhillyCocoa. That was always the goal, for me. The other "neat stuff" is just what happens when you get a bunch of talented, interesting, friendly people in the same room.

I gave some reasonably convincing approximation of my best effort to get PhillyCocoa going, but I really think it's time for some new blood. Way before I had any notion of moving I was hoping to transition myself out the sole-organizer role in 2011. I think an organization like PhillyCocoa needs some leadership change every few years to keep it healthy and growing. I am looking forward to see what the gang does while I'm away.

**Plug:** If you have any interest in what is happening with PhillyCocoa, you should come to the [December 2010 CocoaHeads](http://phillycocoa.org/2010-12-7/) meeting.

## Epilogue

This was **not** an easy decision. There was no wrong answer. But I feel really good about the decision I made and am excited to see where it takes me.

I don't have the stereotypical startup aspirations of changing the world and getting rich. I do however, think we can change a little part of some people's worlds and make a living while doing it. That's my dream, and I'm taking a shot at it.

## TL;DR

I'm joining a [startup](http://mindsnacks.com) to work on stuff I'm passionate about. I'll be moving to the San Francisco Bay Area but have the option to relocate back to Philly after 1 year. This is a great opportunity for experience and adventure, and I'm really excited.
