In [Learning the Terminal on the Mac - Part 4](http://mrox.net/blog/2008/08/09/learning-the-terminal-on-the-mac-part-4-bringing-finder-and-terminal-together/), I mentioned a mini-application called [OpenTerminalHere](href="http://jo.irisson.free.fr/?p=59) that opens a new Terminal in the same directory as the current Finder window.  Well recently [Dan Benjamin](http://hivelogic.com/articles/view/mac-os-x-toolbar-button-to-open-a-terminal-window) linked to another, nearly identical application called [cdto](http://code.google.com/p/cdto/).

Both toolbar applications work as advertised, but cdto takes the extra step of clearing the scrollback buffer after changing directories, yielding a slightly cleaner workspace.  cdto is also hosted on Google Code, so it's easy to grab the source on hack on it.

Enjoy.
